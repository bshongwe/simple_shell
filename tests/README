# TEST SUITE
To get going on the tests, simply copy the files into your current project directory.

The "results" directory stores test results

  <code>results</code>


Command that runs all the commands:

  <code>./run-tests.csh</code>


To run a specific test, type:

  <code>./run-tests.csh <testNumber></code>

as in

  <code>./run-tests.csh atou.c</code>


Each specific test attends to each specific test case.
